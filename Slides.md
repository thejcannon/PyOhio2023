As little Leio Python was tucked in his bed,
"Mommy, how are objects made?" is what he said.

"Well..." said his mommy, that's not so easy to say,
How would you answer that question that day?

She thought for a moment on her answer, the result,
and wanted to start with "consenting adults",
but nuance is often lost on the young,
so that's wasn't something that rolled off her tongue.

"Well, it first takes a class", is what rolled off of it,
"Oh I know!" said young Leio, "it's `__init__`".
"Not quite" hissed his mother, as her tongue flicked and twisted,
"it participates, of course, but `self` already existed!"

"oh, huh" said the snakelet, "i guess that's true,
so who made the object all fresh and brand new?"
"Hush", said Momma, "and I'll tell it to you
that object was came from by the classes' `__new__`".
